## Part 1
* Use the Python library CitiPy to choose 500 cities throughout the world.
* Use the OpenWeatherMap API to pull weather data about each city.
* Plot different weather attributes against the latitude of each city.  
* Run linear regression for each weather attribute and the latitudes of the Northern & Southern hemispheres.
* Save a csv file of the retrieved weather data for each city.

## Part 2
* Use Google Maps to display a heatmap of the humidity of the cities from part 1.
* Find cities that match ideal weather conditions.
* Use the Google Places API to find a hotel in each city.
* Use Google Maps to display each city with a marker over the humidity heatmap.  Each marker will display the hotel name, city name, and country when clicked.
